# Rocillo_Laboratory-Activity-2

# Project overview 
- In this project, we implemented CRUD API through Postman, it is shown here that in order to do all of those commands/actions we need to have folders and files thatt is connected to the database so that we can extract or add data to it (e.g. controllers, routes, and config). We first learn how to do it with a step by step guide that is in our UST Portal through our Course by our Professor. At the end, after we have done those, we are tasked to create another database and to do CRUD in that database.
