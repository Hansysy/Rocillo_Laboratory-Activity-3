# Rocillo_Laboratory-Activity-2

# Project overview 
- In this project, we authenticate our API through Postman, like the last project, it is shown here that in order to do all of those authentications, we need to have folders and files thatt is connected to the database so that we can authenticate (e.g. controllers, routes, config, middleware). In here we can see that there are ways to have your token changed and at the end we test different kinds of error.
